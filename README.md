# NeoVIM Configuration

## NeoVIM is my go-to editor

I use NeoVIM + Alacritty + tmux because the setup is fast and responsive.
However, I am a newb in many ways. For over one year I have been using NVIM with a configuration that was copied from elsewhere. Now that I have a much better grasp of development tools and techniques, I am attempting to create my own Neovim config file from scratch.

## Goals
### My overall intent is to replace VSCODE as a main IDE

- Syntax highlighting for HTML, CSS, JS, GO ++
- Fuzzyfinding
- Auto formatting or beuatification 'if possible'
- Homepage
