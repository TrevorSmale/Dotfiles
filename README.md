# Config Files

## This is a copy of my custom configurations
I started using command line interface tools and have settled on a pairing that I believe will stand the test of time.
When it comes to configuring my tools I am a smooth brain. However, I am slowly customizing my tools bit by bit from the ground up. 

## Repository structure

There are folders dedicated to each tool eg. Alacritty. Within each tool folder is a README and config file. I will do my best to clearly indicated the steps needed in order to get things working in each dedicated README.

## Descriptions

Alacritty - Is an Open Source cross platform terminal.
Neovim - Is a mouseless text editing instrument with many speed focused commands.
TMUX - Is a terminal multiplexor that both allows for terminal window management and session management.
